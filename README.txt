This is a simple pet project for a backend that handles sign-in and sign-up for a blog, in any case a small part of frontend is present, managed thanks to the ejs template engine.
For this project in node.js I used the express framework because of the stability and the extensive documentation available.
Other dependecies required are Body-parser for handle POST parameters and the library lodash.
I also used bcrypt and cookie-parser to hash password and cookie values
in the next update I intend to make a connection with mongodb and create a real CRUD structure.
