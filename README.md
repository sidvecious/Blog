This is a simple pet project for a backend that handles sign-in and sign-up for a blog, in any case a small part of frontend is present, managed thanks to the ejs template engine.
The program is split beetwen development '''npm run dev''' and production mode  '''npm run prod'''
For this project in node.js I used the express framework because of the stability and the extensive documentation available. 
Other dependecies required are Body-parser for handle POST parameters and the library lodash.
I also used bcrypt and cookie-parser to hash password and cookie values
in the next update I intend to make a connection with mongodb and create a real CRUD structure.
